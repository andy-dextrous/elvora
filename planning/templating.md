# Templates

- Templates in a Smart Site are simply arrays of section blocks.
- A route is a document from any collection that has a valid URI field
- Route documents must have a sections field to be rendered on the front end.
- Templates are created in multiple ways

## Template Construction

1. **Highest Priority**: Built into the page as section blocks
2. **Level 2**: Assigned by the settings/routing global
3. **Level 3**: Default template inherited
