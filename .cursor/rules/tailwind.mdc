# Tailwind Configuration

- This website used Tailwind v4. This means that all config is handled inside css files.
- All tailwind code is located inside src/app/(frontend)/css
- globals.css is the entrypoint
- Since this is a website, not an app, we use a strict design system that is built into theme.css
- base.css is used to define the base styles of elements
- typography.css is used to set all typography styling site-wide. Always write typography that is congruent with teh design system. You won't need to add classes to headings, text, links etc - they will all be inherited from teh design system at the element level. Only use new classes for color changes etc - things that are unique to the current section.
- theme.css is where you will find the colors to be applied to all JSX youw write.
